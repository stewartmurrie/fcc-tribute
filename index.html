                        In his early years he worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampex">Ampex</a> on both their first tape-based audio and video recorders. Later, whilst a PhD student at<a href="http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/"> Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>,
                        he would make tape recordings of classical concerts in the college chapel, but was frequently frustrated by the poor quality of the results. It was this obsession towards high-fidelity music that ultimately led him to found

                            world.

                        Dolby A was designed for professional tape recorders, but as consumer cassette tapes become popular Dolby realised his technology could improve the quality of music in the home, too. Thus was born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_noise-reduction_system#Dolby_B">Dolby B Noise Reduction</a>,
                        the technology that firmly established Dolby as a household name. Ray would continue his pursuit of ever-higher quality analogue audio, culminuating in his <em>magnum opus</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_SR">Dolby SR</a>,
                        introduced in the 1908s and still used in analogue recordings today.

                        Meanwhile, an ever-growing corps of researchers and developers at Dolby Labs were advancing the forefront of digital audio technology, including the highly-successful surround-sound format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital">Dolby Digital</a>.
                        What started as a technology for moive theatres went to become the domninant audio system for DVDs, game consoles, and televisions around the world.
