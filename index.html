                                In his early years he worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampex">Ampex</a> on both their first tape-based audio and video recorders. Later, whilst a PhD student at<a href="http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/"> Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>,
                                he would make tape recordings of classical concerts in the college chapel, but was frequently frustrated by the poor quality of the results. It was this obsession towards high-fidelity music that ultimately led him to found
                                <a href="http://www.dolby.com">Dolby Laboratories, Inc.</a> where he developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_noise-reduction_system#Dolby_A">Dolby A Noise Reduction</a>, a system which would soon become ubiquitous
                                in recording studios around the world.</p>

                                Dolby A was designed for professional tape recorders, but as consumer cassette tapes become popular Dolby realised his technology could improve the quality of music in the home, too. Thus was born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_noise-reduction_system#Dolby_B">Dolby B Noise Reduction</a>,
                                the technology that firmly established Dolby as a household name. Ray would continue his pursuit of ever-higher quality analogue audio, culminuating in his
                                <em>magnum opus</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_SR">Dolby SR</a>, introduced in the 1908s and still used in analogue recordings today.

                                Meanwhile, an ever-growing corps of researchers and developers at Dolby Labs were advancing the forefront of digital audio technology, including the highly-successful surround-sound format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital">Dolby Digital</a>.
                                What started as a technology for moive theatres went to become the domninant audio system for DVDs, game consoles, and televisions around the world.

                        <p>Towards the end of his life Ray suffered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease">Alzheimer's Disease</a>, a progressive form of dementia that causes memory loss and behavioural changes in estimated 44
                            million people worldwide. No cure is yet known, but early diagnosis and treatment can slow progression of the disease.</p>

                        <p>After Ray's death in 2013, the Dolby family, together with <a href="http://www.dolbyventures.com/">Dolby Family Ventures</a>, honoured Ray's belief in the power of science and engineer to solve human problems by investing millions
                            of dollars in companies researching treatments and therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease. Most significantly, this included a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Dolby-Labs-founder-s-legacy-helping-dementia-5763467.php">donation of $21m</a>                            to fund the <a href="http://www.cpmc.org/advanced/neurosciences/brainhealth/">Ray Dolby Brain Health Center</a> at the California Pacific Medical Center.</p>
