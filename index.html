        <p class="lead">Dr. Ray Dolby, OBE, (1933–2013) was an American inventor and businessman who made major contributions to both audio and video technology over a 60-year career. In his early years he worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampex">Ampex</a>
            on both their first tape-based audio and video recorders.

                  Whilst a PhD student at<a href="http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/"> Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>,
                  he would make tape recordings of classical concerts in the college chapel, but was frequently frustrated by
                  the poor quality of the results. It was this obsession towards high-fidelity music that ultimately led him to found <a href="http://www.dolby.com">Dolby Laboratories, Inc.</a> where he developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_noise-reduction_system#Dolby_A">Dolby A Noise Reduction</a>, a system which would soon become ubiquitous in recording studios around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dolby A was designed for professional tape recorders, but as consumer cassette tapes become popular Dolby realised his technology could improve the quality of music in the home, too. Thus was born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_noise-reduction_system#Dolby_B">Dolby B Noise Reduction</a>, the technology that firmly established Dolby as a household name. Ray would continue his pursuit of ever-higher quality analogue audio, culminuating in his <em>magnum opus</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_SR">Dolby SR</a>, introduced in the 1908s and still used in analogue recordings today.

                     Meanwhile, an ever-growing corps of researchers and developers at Dolby Labs were advancing the forefront of digital audio technology, including the highly-successful surround-sound format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital">Dolby Digital</a>. What started as a technology for moive theatres went to become the domninant audio system for DVDs, game consoles, and televisions around the world.

                  Today, Ray Dolby's legacy as an innovator in media technology lives on. The company he founded with four employees in in London 1965 now spans the globe with almost 1900 employees in over 30 countries. Dolby expanded their audio formats to include Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Atmos and their latest next-generation audio system, <a href="http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/AC-4.html">Dolby AC-4</a>, and also branched out into video enhancement with <a href=
