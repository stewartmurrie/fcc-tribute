        <p class="lead">Dr. Ray Dolby, OBE, (1933–2013) was an American inventor and businessman who made major contributions to both audio and video technology over a 60-year career. In his early years he worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampex">Ampex</a>
            on both their first tape-based audio and video recorders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst a PhD student at<a href="http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/"> Pembroke College, Cambridge</a>,
          he would make tape recordings of classical concerts in the college chapel, but was frequently frustrated by
          the poor quality of the results. It was this obsession towards high-fidelity music that ultimately led him to found <a href="http://www.dolby.com">Dolby Laboratories</a> where he developed the <em>Dolby A</em> Noise Reduction, a system which would soon become ubiquitous in recording studios around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dolby A was designed for professional tape recorders, but as consumer cassette tapes become popular Dolby realised his technology could improve the quality of music in the home, too. Thus was born <em>Dolby B</em> Noise Reduction, the technology
          that firmly established Dolby as a household name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ray Dolby would continue his pursuit of ever-higher quality analogue audio, culminuating in his <em>magnum opus</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_SR">Dolby SR</a>, introduced in the 1908s and still used in analogue recordings today.           Meanwhile, an ever-growing corps of researchers and developers at Dolby Labs were advancing the forefront of digital audio technology, including the most sucessful surround-sound format in the world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital">Dolby Digital</a>, becoming the domninant sound technology for movie theaters, DVD, game consoles, and broadcasters around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Ray Dolby's legacy as an innovator in media technology lives on. The company he founded with four employees in in London 1965 now spans the globe wih almost 1900 employees. Dolby expanded their audio formats to include Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Atmos and their latest next-generation audio system, <a href="http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/AC-4.html">Dolby AC-4</a>, and also branched out into video enhancement with Dolby 3D and the Dolby Vision high-dynamic range display technology. Dolby has even found their way into teleconference market, shaking up the industry with their enhanced Dolby Voice system.
